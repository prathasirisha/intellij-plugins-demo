//We spend most of our time in our IDE, a percentage of the time that we spend elsewhere is usually the time when we are on our browser, third-party tools - ticket tracking system, CI/CD frameworks, etc.This quickly adds up, this is where the customizing IDE shines through.

. We are all different, and our preferences are different.
. We all work for companies that have different coding guidelines and frameworks.
. Frameworks that are unique to you or to your company, for which there is no plugin in the Open Source marketplace.
. Workflows that are unique to you or to your company, version control and CI/CD hooks.
. Tasks that are repetitive.
